# Pattern Use Case


## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
### Purpose: 
Manage access to contract functions based on predefined roles. This enables granular control over who can perform specific actions.
### Use Cases:
- Implementing a permissioned system within a contract, allowing only authorized users to perform sensitive operations.
- Granting different roles with varying capabilities (e.g., admin, user, moderator) within a decentralized application.
### Example: 
A contract with roles like "owner," "minter," and "burner" for managing token creation and destruction.


## Circuit Breaker Pattern
### Purpose:
Provides a mechanism to pause contract functionality in case of errors or unexpected events. This helps prevent further damage and allows for recovery actions.
### Use Cases:
- Protecting DeFi protocols from oracle failures, denial-of-service attacks, or critical bugs.
- Temporarily halting token trading or withdrawals during market volatility or security incidents.
### Example: 
 A DEX contract with a circuit breaker that pauses trading if the oracle price feed becomes unreliable


## Withdrawal Pattern (Commonly Used)
### Purpose: 
Defines a secure way for users to withdraw funds from a contract. This pattern avoids accidentally sending funds to a contract that might not handle them correctly
### Use Cases:
- Implementing secure withdrawals in escrow contracts, token vaults, or savings accounts.
- Performing additional checks or actions before transferring funds (e.g., fee deductions, withdrawal limits).
### Example:
 A withdraw function in an escrow contract that checks user balances, updates internal state, and then transfers funds using payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount).


## Factory Pattern (Commonly Used):
### Purpose: 
Creates objects dynamically without specifying their exact types. This allows for flexibility and future-proofing your contracts.
### Use Cases:
- Deploying different contract types based on constructor arguments (e.g., creating various token types with a single factory).
- Simplifying contract creation logic and centralizing deployment management.
### Example: 
A factory contract that can create either ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens based on input parameters.


## Proxy Pattern (Commonly Used):
### Purpose: 
Provides an intermediary contract that controls access to another contract (target contract). This enables upgradability and separation of concerns.
### Use Cases:
- Upgrading smart contracts without redeploying the entire codebase. The proxy remains the same, while the target contract behind it can be updated.
- Implementing access control logic through the proxy, directing calls to the target contract based on permissions.
### Example: 
A proxy contract that controls a lending pool implementation, allowing upgrades to the pool logic without affecting user interactions.


## State Machine Pattern (Commonly Used)
### Purpose: 
Manages the state transitions within a contract. It defines a finite set of states and valid transitions between them, ensuring a clear and controlled flow of execution.
### Use Cases:
- Modeling multi-stage processes like escrow services (created, funded, delivered, completed, dispute) or voting systems (open, closed, counting, finalized).
- Enforcing state-specific actions and preventing invalid transitions.
### Example: 
A voting contract that tracks the voting state (open for submissions, closed for voting, counting votes, results announced) and restricts actions based on the current state.


## Library Pattern (Commonly Used):
### Purpose: 
Groups reusable functions and variables into a separate contract. This promotes code reuse, modularity, and gas optimization (functions in libraries are deployed once and can be linked by other contracts).
### Use Cases:
- Sharing common mathematical functions (e.g., calculations for token distribution or price calculations) across multiple contracts.
- Creating reusable helper functions for string manipulation, data structures, or security checks.
### Example:
 A library containing functions for calculating square roots, performing safe integer arithmetic, or validating user inputs.


## Guard Check Pattern (Commonly Used):
### Purpose: 
Enforces preconditions before function execution. Guard checks are typically implemented as modifiers, improving code readability and maintainability.
### Use Cases:
- Validating user roles or permissions before allowing them to perform sensitive actions.
- Ensuring sufficient funds or resources are available before performing operations.
- Checking for specific states (e.g., not paused) before processing transactions.
### Example: 
A modifier that checks if a user has the "admin" role before allowing them to call an administrative function.
